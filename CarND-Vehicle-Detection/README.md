## Vehicle Detection Project

The aims of this project is to detect vehicles from a movie shot from the viewpoint of a driver, which is crucial for a self
driving car to be able to handle road situations. The main task is therefore object detection, which has been a long running computer
vision research topic.

In the project rubric for udacity, it calls for using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method to extract features and
run a classifier for object detection. However, this is a rather old method that newer deep learning based models has mostly replaced.
Therefore, to get to the end goal of annotating a video stream, I used a neural network based model.

There are 3 parts to the project-- an initial exploration of the traditional HOG extraction so I can gain an understanding of the technique, an experiment with a fine tuned mobilenet using the sliding window method, and utilising one of the newest object
detection models-- single shot detection

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)


### Fine tuning Mobilenet with sliding sliding windows

The output video performance is more or less acceptable, detecting the 2 main cars closest to the camera. However, there is still
a lot of jitter and a few false positives, which could potentially be resolved by experimenting with more window sizes and better/
more training data. However, the main issue with this approach is the time taken to process each image. Using python's `time` module, the network takes around 3s per image, which is nowhere near sufficient to run this in real time. (some of the earliest neural network based object detection used this approach, with more or less the same problem.)

The output video of this experiment can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/wwymak/udacity-selfdrivingcar-nd/blob/master/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/outvideo_mobilenet_full.mp4)

### Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD)

The original implementation of SSD is in Caffe, however, as I am more familiar with Keras, I used the Keras implementation of
SSD from  https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras instead. 

A fairly recent CNN based object detector is the single shot multiBox detector (ref [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325))


The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector.
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/513/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook (or in lines # through # of the file called `some_file.py`).  

I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

![alt text][image1]

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:


![alt text][image2]

#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

I tried various combinations of parameters and...

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

I trained a linear SVM using...

### Sliding Window Search

#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

I decided to search random window positions at random scales all over the image and came up with this (ok just kidding I didn't actually ;):

![alt text][image3]

#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)


#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:

### Here the resulting bounding boxes are drawn onto the last frame in the series:

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
